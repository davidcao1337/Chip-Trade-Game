Project Name: Chip Trade Game
Authors: David Cao & Tu Cao

Beta Start Date: May 28, 2020
Current Version: Beta 1.0

Description: 
Based on an original tabletop game, Chip Trade is a strategic probability game. The objective
of the game is to flip multiple chips and based on the amount that are faced up, you obtain a
card. Collect a certain amount of cards and you win. While playing, you have access to various
power-ups which have some interesting effects. This game of chance is simple on the surface,
but has many intricate mechanics that gives this game its strategic depth.

Patch Notes:

Technical Change
- Programming language changed to Swift for iOS

Brand New User-Interface

"Beta 1.0 is a major milestone for us. With the change of platform from the black and white command line UI on PC 
 to the colorful game board UI on iOS. The new UI is more interactive and dynamic."

- It features custom design buttons for the roll and trade actions as well as the power ups.
- A health bar is added to match the amount of chips you have on the board.
- The amount of cards you have is displayed, allowing you to see how close you are to victory.
- Chips greyed out are chips in the graveyard.
- Buttons that are greyed out are unavailable until conditions are met to enable their use (refer to rules).
- The gear button allows you to return to the main menu.
- The "Settings" and "Credits" buttons are currently disabled (no content as of yet)

Power Re-work
- The Red Bandage is now a guaranteed use. A four-sided die is rolled; the result determines the amount of chips recovered.

"We felt that the Red Bandage wasn't a reliable enough power. In moments where players are low on chips, a failed
 roll was very punishing. You could either gain a miniscule amount of chips back or lose chips (even worse!). The element of probability
 still exists with the rolling of a four-sided die. Rolling a 1 would be unlucky, a 2 is decent, and a 3 or 4 would be good.
 As a result, this rework increases player sustainability."
